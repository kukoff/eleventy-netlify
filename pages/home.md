## I'm Zak,

an investor at Emergence Capital. Previously, I worked at Flexport and founded an education technology startup that was backed by Techstars. I've also worked at First Round Capital's Dorm Room Fund, where I was a managing partner helping oversee the fund; at Stripes Group, where I was an analyst doing growth equity investing; and at the NewSchools Venture Fund's Reach Capital, where I spent time on the investment team. Along with my work, I've been featured in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, TechCrunch, Bloomberg View, and The Next Web, and have been honored by the Clinton Global Initiative and NBC Education Nation.
