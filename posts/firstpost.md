I was recently thinking about different options available to someone trying to start a career in venture. Venture Capital is still very much an apprenticeship industry — which is to say that junior VCs are enabled by the abilities of those they work with — and so the best way to learn about investing is to work with investors you respect.

When I began to think about making a move to venture, I was repeatedly told that the opportunities to do so are boundless (especially for recent college grads or those in their early 20s). But that likely won’t ring true to you if you’re outside of the Valley community: many of the opportunities to build a career in venture are geared at folks who are already well-networked (or already part of a company on a breakout trajectory, which can be similar). As a result, while the pathways to starting a career in VC are more varied than ever for those already inside of the Valley community, the geography/network barrier can still feel imposing.

So what should an aspiring investor do? There’s a ton of great strategic advice on building a career in the industry, but I wanted to address some specific, replicable, and most of all tactical advice that I benefitted from when I decided to move into venture.

# Find your network

Semil Shah has written about the importance of building context to enter VC — something I strongly agree with. There are plenty of ways to build context (and he listed a bunch in his post), but the easiest way for most people is likely to find an existing network to join. It’s significantly harder to build your own network than stepping into one that already exists.

## For students at schools with existing entrepreneurial communities:

At almost every major college in the country, there are opportunities to become part of entrepreneurial communities. If you’re at a city (SF, NYC, Philly, or Boston) served by Dorm Room Fund or Rough Draft Ventures, that should be your first preference: they’re both strong communities of students where you’ll have a chance to learn the skillset of venture investing (and where you’ll develop a portfolio of picks you can point to later). They’re also strong forcing-functions for you to become more active generally in your school’s entrepreneurial community. If you’re considering joining either and want to chat more, I’m happy to do so. I was part of DRF while in college and it was one of my favorite experiences.

If your school has an entrepreneurial center or existing community, it probably makes sense to join. Think about ways you can make yourself central to that community: can you organize events? Cold-email VCs, founders, or speakers who might speak for free (or with costs covered)? Align your classroom and extracurricular skills with your entrepreneurial contributions. For example, if you were in debate or mock trial, you could lead a pitch workshop where you prep founders by asking tough questions about their business.

## For everyone else:

Besides existing school-based entrepreneurial networks, one of the best ways to build a strong central network for yourself is to join a breakout trajectory startup. While I don’t necessarily believe in doing something totally unrelated to hopefully break into venture, the truth is that folks at those companies generally get a powerful cohort effect. If you can find a role you’re genuinely passionate about (possibly special projects, a rotational role, or anything with a generally understood end-date), you’ll also see a steep professional growth/learning curve while there (even just as an intern!).

Beyond learning rapidly, working at a rocket ship startup (or one perceived that way) also increases the chance that people will be interested in meeting you, helping you build a network around yourself. The cohort effect of working at a hypergrowth company — plus the ability to leverage the interest in your company to interact with a wider group of people — can accelerate your progress to building needed context.

The other way to build context has a slightly longer time to value but, I think, is equally worthwhile. If you live in a place without an entrepreneurial community — or you’re looking to augment your existing social circle beyond the company you’ve joined and your friends — a good proxy for entrepreneurship is building relationships with ambitious and bright groups of people. While tech and entrepreneurship are broadly becoming more appealing career paths, there are plenty of people who haven’t considered them (or are waiting until they have an idea they’re passionate about). Becoming central to multiple groups of ambitious, intelligent people in your geographic area and serving as the connective tissue between them builds immediate context and positions you to be the venture/investment leader connecting your area to the Valley. Reaching out to investors — even cold — and offering to introduce them the brightest people in your area is a win-win: you build a relationship with venture investors, and investors find either future founders or potential hires for portfolio companies.

# Find your evangelist

Much of the Valley ultimately runs on social proof, which can seem daunting if you’re geographically or socially disconnected from the community. Here’s two pieces of good news: 1) breaking into the community is often easy as finding one influential person who you hit it off with, and 2) a tremendous number of influential people are more open than you’d think to meeting you. Many, many investors have blogged or tweeted about the best way to get in touch with them cold or are willing to let you know if you reach out via Twitter (especially if you’re active on it — that helps give a sense for your personality before you’ve even met).

Once you’ve identified some well-networked investors you respect (and once you’ve figured out how they prefer to be contacted), try and see if you have a warm connection within a degree or two of separation (LinkedIn and Twitter are both great for this). If you can’t get a warm introduction, it’s worth writing a cold email or DM — luckily, there’s a lot of advice about how best to do that.

When I first thought about leaving Flexport for VC, I was lucky to get introduced to Semil Shah by Delian Asparouhov (thanks Delian!). Semil and I met for coffee, and between that and an email followup he felt comfortable enough to send a rare recommendation of me to a group of investors he knows. Most importantly, I made it clear to Semil that I had already built a limited network and that I was willing to be a super junior member of a firm to have the opportunity to learn from talented investors.

As an aside, here’s a piece of seemingly obvious and yet rarely followed advice: if you’re asking someone for a favor and they ask you to email them something, do it ASAP. When Semil and I spoke about this blog post, he mentioned that a big reason he was willing to recommend me to his network was my homework assignment.

Suddenly I found myself able to build something close to a recruiting process, which can be rare in venture. One email from Semil prompted an incredible number of VCs who were hiring to reach out to me. Almost none of those VCs had publicly indicated they were hiring, and presumably even fewer would have been open to a cold email.

Semil went above and beyond any expectation I had for our meeting and I’m immensely grateful to him for doing so. Unfortunately, there’s a fair amount of luck involved here: someone isn’t going to go out on a limb and recommend you to their network if you don’t have good chemistry in a meeting, and that can be dependent on personality as much as anything else.

Ultimately, my own experience underscored the power — and necessity — of social capital. If you want access to the best opportunities (many of which aren’t public), you need someone who can help make you top of mind.

\-----------------------

As my own search concluded, I ended up choosing to work with the team at Emergence Capital (as I’ve alluded to on Twitter). I was attracted to Emergence for a few reasons, including their tremendous investment focus, their interest in junior career development, and — most of all — the opportunity to work with a team of venture investors I tremendously respect.

Both in my search and before it, I’ve been lucky to be part of some great communities and have some great folks go out of their way to help me. But one of the great things about the Valley is that the circumstances that I enjoyed — in large part via luck — can be replicated and repeated. There’s a democratization of opportunity, but right now it’s unevenly distributed, and I’m hopeful that the tactical advice I’ve given above can help.
